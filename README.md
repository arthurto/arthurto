### Hi there 👋

My name is Arthur Pasqualotto and i'm a Graduate Student @UFSM (Universidade Federal de Santa Maria) currently in my Masters.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Effective Models of QCD for High Density Quark Matter and its Astrophysical Phenomenology trough the study of Neutron and Quark Stars.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Julia to develop my reaserch on Physics, but i'm also a lover of Mathematics and all sort of numerical simulations. 
- 💬 Ask me about Physics, Mathematics & anything you want!!

Recently building a Numerical Julia Package of functions i needed and couldn't find elswere. (https://github.com/arthurto/NumericalJulia)

My love for symulations can be seen in my numerical solutions of 1-D Schrödinger's Equation from Quantum Mechanics. (https://github.com/arthurto/Schr-dinger.py)
